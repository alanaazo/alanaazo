## Hi there 👋

Hello 👋  
I’m Alana — a Quantitative Analyst and Data Scientist passionate about risk modeling and machine learning.

Most recently, I worked at **Generous Energy (USA)**, where I designed and implemented algorithmic trading and portfolio optimization strategies for the US electricity market. My focus was on turning complex forecasting models and convex optimization frameworks into robust production pipelines.

Before that, I spent over two years as a **Risk Data Analyst at Alfa-Bank**, the largest private bank in Russia, where I helped implement the Basel II IRB approach for credit risk retail models that reduced capital requirements by 20%, and detected anomalies in the Probability of Default, Loss Given Default, Exposure at Default models.

I hold an **M.Sc. in Data Science** from the **University of Barcelona**, where my research explored **news recommendation systems and evaluation metrics** (RecSys Challenge 2024 case study).  

Here, you’ll find university projects related to: \
⚙️ Credit default swaps prediction \
🧠 Machine learning and recommender systems  \
💬 NLP \

A few facts about me:  
🚀 Work on end-to-end trading algorithm production pipelines  
📈 Experienced in convex optimization, CVaR frameworks, credit risk models (Probability of Default, Loss Given Default, Exposure At Default)
🎓 M.Sc. in Data Science (University of Barcelona), B.Sc. in Economics (HSE University)  
🌍 Based in Barcelona — authorized for remote work worldwide (Digital Nomad Visa)  
💬 Passionate about bridging data science and real-world impact
